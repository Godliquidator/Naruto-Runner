# Naruto-Runner
A project based on opencv python program that automates the game by itself


I have automated the Naruto Runner Game using concepts that i learned in a workshop
The link to that game: https://trex-runner.com/naruto/

I am pleased to present to you all the pros and cons of the code.

Pro's :
1) The automated game consistenly crosses the 100 mark and highest score recorded was 300+. 
   Since the game is very random and sometimes the enemies are too close to each other,
   achieving a perfect run every time is not possible.
Con's :
1) The top left and bottom right window coordinates should be kept (0,0) & (1063,1020) respectively.
2) After 3-5 continuous runs, the automation stops working efficiently 
   due to buffer distances added after every run.
